Cool projects I've been working on

## Github Command and Control Trojan
1. Program that can pull and execute arbitrary code uploaded to my GIthub account

2. Hacked Python import statements to allow importing modules from Github

3. Each trojan is given an id and a configuration file tells the trojan exactly what to do based on the id. For example, specific code can be given for a trojan with id "a" and difference code can be given from trojan "b"

4. Multihreading capabilities

## gitlet
1. Mini version of popular version-controls system git

2. Includes the following commands: init, add, commit, remove, log, global log, find, status, checkout, branch, remove branch, reset, merge, rebase

3. Custom hashcode function for commits involving timestamp and commit message to avoid commit conflicts

4. Increase of memory usage between commits is linear with respect to the size of files addedâ€”there are NO redundant identical copies of files

5. Full spec here: http://cs61b.ug/sp15/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html

## WordAnalyzer
1. Analyzes and plots information from Google's n-gram dataset (information on n-grams here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)

2. Segmented information of a word into the following categories: length of words, synonyms to the word, number of times the word appeared in a given year, number of times the word appeared in all years, and comparisons in how frequently two or more different words have appeared, information on the relative popularity of the category of word

3. Can generate graphs for visual comparisons

## Checkers+
1. Checkers implementation with a twist--has bomb pieces that will explode
to capture all nearby pieces and shield pieces which can resist the bombs

2. Point-and-click GUI
